# My-50-Dart-Challenges-Journey
My progress through 50 Dart programming challenges, from beginner to pro.

Beginner Level (1-15): The Basics

These challenges focus on variables, basic operators, and control flow structures like if-else and for loops.

Sum of Two Numbers: Ask the user for two numbers and print their sum.

Simple Interest Calculator: Calculate simple interest given principal, time, and rate. Formula: .

Even or Odd Checker: Check if a given integer is even or odd.

Largest of Three Numbers: Find the largest number among three integers.

Multiplication Table Generator: Generate the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.

Vowel or Consonant: Check if a character is a vowel or a consonant.

Leap Year Checker: Determine if a year is a leap year.

Positive, Negative, or Zero: Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Sum of Natural Numbers: Calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers.

Reverse a String: Write a program that reverses a given string.

Palindrome Checker: Check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward).

Factorial of a Number: Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.

Prime Number Check: Determine if a given number is a prime number.

Fibonacci Series: Print the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms.

Simple Number Guessing Game: Generate a random number and let the user guess it, providing "too high" or "too low" hints.

Intermediate Level (16-30): Data Structures & Functions

Here, you'll work with lists, maps, functions, and the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Function to Find Max/Min: Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the maximum and minimum values.

Remove Duplicates: Create a program that removes duplicate elements from a list.

Word Frequency Counter: Count the frequency of each word in a sentence using a Map.

Temperature Converter: Create functions to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Anagram Checker: Check if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in different orders).

Basic BankAccount Class: Create a class BankAccount with methods to deposit, withdraw, and checkBalance.

Sort a List (Bubble Sort): Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers without using the built-in .sort() method.

Matrix Addition: Add two matrices (represented as lists of lists) of the same size.

Student Grade Calculator: Create a Student class that stores marks in three subjects and has a method to calculate the average and assign a grade.

Email Validator: Write a function that validates an email address format using a regular expression.

Decimal to Binary Converter: Convert a decimal number to its binary representation.

Find Common Elements: Find the common elements between two lists.

Caesar Cipher: Implement a Caesar cipher function that encrypts and decrypts a message by shifting letters by a certain number of places.

Console To-Do List: A simple command-line to-do list application where you can add, view, and remove tasks.

Shape Area Calculator (Inheritance): Create a base class Shape and derived classes Circle and Rectangle that override an calculateArea() method.

Advanced Level (31-40): Algorithms & File Handling

This section introduces more complex algorithms, error handling, file I/O, and advanced OOP concepts.

File Word Counter: Read a text file and count the total number of words in it.

Custom Exception Handling: Create a function that validates a user's age. Throw a custom exception if the age is negative and handle it using a try-catch-on block.

JSON Parsing: Parse a JSON string (e.g., {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'}) into a User object.

Implement a Stack: Create a Stack class with push, pop, peek, and isEmpty methods.

Implement a Queue: Create a Queue class with enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty methods.

Using Mixins: Create a Performer class. Then create Dancer and Singer mixins with methods performDance() and performSong(). Apply them to the Performer class.

Hangman Game: Implement the classic Hangman game on the console.

Sieve of Eratosthenes: Implement this algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer.

Find the Longest Common Subsequence: Write a program to find the longest common subsequence between two strings.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Create a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the console.     

Expert / Pro Level (41-50): Asynchronous Programming & System Design

These challenges focus on real-world scenarios, including asynchronous operations, API interaction, concurrency, and software design patterns.

Fetch Data from API: Use the http package and async/await to fetch data from a public REST API (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1) and print the result.

Stream Processing: Create a Stream that emits integers every second. Write a listener that filters for even numbers and prints their square.

Basic Web Scraper: Use an HTTP client to fetch the HTML content of a website and extract all the hyperlink (<a>) tags.

Concurrency with Isolates: Perform a CPU-intensive task (like calculating a very large factorial) in a separate Isolate to prevent the main thread from freezing.

Command-Line Tool (CLI): Build a simple CLI tool that takes a file path as an argument and counts the lines, words, and characters in that file (similar to wc in Linux).

Singleton Design Pattern: Implement a DatabaseConnection class using the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance can be created.

REST API Client: Create a class that acts as a client for a REST API, with methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

Generic Repository Pattern: Implement a generic Repository class for data access that can work with different data models (e.g., UserRepository, ProductRepository).

Basic Chat Server: Write a simple TCP server using dart:io that can accept multiple client connections and broadcast messages between them.

Dependency Injection Container: Implement a basic service locator or dependency injection container to manage and provide dependencies within a larger application.
